# The Conflict

I've encountered a conflict between two things which I see in how dice systems work for TTRPGs
- d100 "roll under" systems provide players with immediate knowledge of the outcome as soon as the die is cast
- d100 systems seem to 'fail more' and seem to have less ability to determine degrees of success

Part of this is likely due to an amgiguity in how GMs can interpret "roll and add" type systems. Specifically I'm going to use skill checks in DnD/Pathfinder/Ars Magica 5e as an example vs rolls in something like 40k's Rogue Trader RPG or other d100 systems. 

DnD
- Roll a d20, add relevant bonuses
- ask the DM what happens
- DM compares the result to the DC, possibly narrating additional success or mitigated success based on the number, or other consequences

Rogue Trader
- Roll a d100
- Rolls above your characteristic score are a failure, although your score can be modified by the difficulty of the result
- GM/the system decides what success or failure means
- Contested rolls may involve checking another character's stats as well, with the possibility that both parties 'fail'

Lancer
- Set up consequences
- Roll a d20, possibly modified by backstory, against a series of set DCs (11+, 20+)
- System instructs GM about the scope of reasonable results, which have been set up ahead of time

It's just very odd to have combats in d100 games where frequently both the attacker and defender roll what the system calls "failures." What does this mean? A sense is given of sort of flailing about, which although fairly mathematically equivalent to similar d20 systems, does produce a certain vibe. HarnMaster has this as well with their combat resolution matrix. Additionally because a successful parry counters a successful attack, this can make success feel less impactful (although this does mirror the way saves work in the 40k wargame, which is pretty thematic). 

On the other hand in DnD an attack roll generates a number, even if you roll very low but have a +10 to hit, there is still the notion that although a 14 doesn't hit the curret target, it could have hit *something.* Some monsters have very low AC, or opponents can be in highly adverse situations (which 5e models with rerolls, a whole different issue from what Pathfinder 1 does by modifying AC). Yet a character with a 60 weapon skill in Rogue Trader, which is rather high, will always miss 40\% of the time.

But that knowledge does appeal to me, that the player knows what a roll is. I think even random encounter charts should be somewhat public, players deserve the fun of reading through a chart to see what exciting events occur, rather than simply waiting for the GM to turn a number into a result. That takes away from the power of the die roll if its outcome is not obvious as the die is cast. For this reason I usually announce the AC of monsters beforehand, both to make rolls more authoritative but also as a way to use the system to narrate the degree of competence their opponent has. 

What are some alternatives?
- Roll the d100 until you get a success, and count how many rolls it takes as a way of measuring degree of success. Could cap this for certain activities, but also results in lots of rolling.
- Use much larger static bonuses on d100 rolls to make straight failure more rare, and focus instead on degrees of success for amgiguous rolls
- Have 4 different outcomes for every contested d100 roll based on the success/failure of both parties

I think part of my issue is that many rolls can sensibly have more outcomes than just yes/no. Let's say you're attempting to convince an NPC to help you in a system where that ends up being decided by a die roll. A reasonable series of outcomes could be
- angered, offended, or decides to actively oppose you
- indifferent to your request
- provides token aid or remains only marginally convinced
- fully helpful to the extent reasonably possible

Ars Magica has a good system for the first, by explicily including rules for rare "botches" in how the system works. This allows for catastrophic results to still be a narritive possibility, while still being atypical. This gives some freedom to really consider interesting and outlandish negative consequences without having the game be too 'swingy.'

But how would that work in a d20 system? Usually the DM either uses set guidelines, or 'feels' how big the roll is. Lancer sort of standardized this with the 3 bands representing exactly failure, mitigated success, and exceptional success being 1-10, 11-20, 21+. However the d100 clearly divides the roll ahead of time into two camps, similar to having a d20 DC announced ahead of time.

Lets look at an equivalent example. Say a character with a 'good' charisma has a +7 on the roll, with a DC 15 to somewhat convince and DC 25 to fully sway an NPC. Equivalently a starting character might have a 45 to Charm on a d100. To be equivalent they would need to make a Charm+20 test, with an exceptional success being at Charm-30. However, I rarely see these sorts of ranges portrayed in Rogue Trader, with the default difficulty being +0.

World of Darkness has had a few iterations of dice pools, invoving difficulty modifying both the target number and required successes to achieve different results. However, this degree of flexibility tends to produce more of a sense of ambiguity. Should you get bonus dice? Is 3 successes enough? 

# The Resolution

What do I want in a system
- Meaning of result is known to all parties when the roll is made
- No ambiguous situations regarding contested rolls
- Allow for degrees of success/failure (but not too many)
- Potentially nonlinearity?

Unfortunately there is no resolution today, the looming question of OSR vs Ars Magica vs HarnMaster remains.
