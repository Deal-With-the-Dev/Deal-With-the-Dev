Many RPGs use dice to tell stories, but exactly *how* they use them varies greatly in terms of philosophy and intention. I want to examine three different cases

- reinterpreting chance as a coherent story
- dice as representation of the unknown
- randomness as forced creativity

and also to argue for a central tenant I stick to with rpgs.

- If you don't want it to be possible in your game, don't make it possible in your system.

## Critical Hits at Level 1

One of the common arguments for fudging dice (see [video by Matt Colville](https://youtu.be/zKN0xPyxu2Y)) is that this can lead to unexpected outcomes which aren't dramatically satisfying in some sense, or appealing to player's desires. The forefront of these examples is the idea that your character could be ignominiously slain by a random mook at level 1. The goblin tossing a spear in a fight which was supposed to be "easy."

You could respond by fudging dice rolls. Don't though, that removes agency from players and devalues the emergent nature of the game experience (or do, I can't stop you). Some games, like DCC, accept the fickle nature of death as a core part of the experience. Taking issue with how 'coddled' these so-called *modern* characters are, compared to a quick creation system leading directly into a capricious world.

While thats one way of doing it, I think the fundamental issue is that `the mechanics shouldn't make something possible in the world which you do not want to be possible.` If you play an RPG where any combat has the possibility of being deadly, and there is a chance (even a small one) that an otherwise unassuming antagonist can strike a mortal blow, then don't blame the dice when occasionally some mook wipes our your character in an otherwise insigifnicant conflict.

It's not the dice, its the system. 

DnD 5e has added death saves to make actual character death rather more rare. An intentional design choice to preserve long-running characters which players can become heavily invested in. Arguably its actually very hard to straight up-die at low levels in that system.

Other games remove the ability for unimportant mooks to score critical hits. OneDND even floated this as a general rule, although a weird backlash (something about DM 'fairness' and having 'fun', an odd perspective when everyone at the table is playing the game together) lead to its removal. Other games embrace this though, the 40k RPGs don't give fate points to random cultists. Lancer has its grunt class enemies (although they still do plenty of damage, but they are less significant by virtue of only ever having 1 HP).

You could even go after the fundamental issue if you move away from a more gamey or simulationist approach to conflict, and instead do something like FATE to establish narritive stakes. Don't want every combat to be potentially lethal? Decide on a narrative level that this conflict can't result in that, and instead play out the game to see what sort of story evolves from this conflict. Maybe the goblins can't kill the heros, but a 'loss' in the combat system results in them stealing an important item, or delaying their journey long enough to give some other faction an advantage, or inflicts some system-specific status condition. Become *wounded* and have *reduced honor*.

#### In conclusion, if you have strong opinions about what is appropriate for a game, choose a system where appropriate things happen. There's no need to cheat yourself out of the experience that a system can provide. Houserules are totally valid as well.

So how can you use dice to tell stories? Let's check three examples.

### Embrance random chance as a way to create canon

> We're playing a game of Rogue Trader. A few times the GM has called for Toughness rolls to avoid space sickness while being battered about during an orbital drop. One of the characters failed consistently (its just a d100 roll). From this point forward the GM decided that they have a particular suceptibility to motion sickness and established that as a fact of the shared world. From now on its a flaw which comes up (rolling to avoid being sick) during rough flights.

There are no systems in place for this, nothing in the rules gives any meaning to failing a roll other than the immediate outcome. It's just a form of resovling dramatic or unknown circumstances.

But on top of this the style of GMing has added an additional assumption. `Dice don't just tell us what happens right now, dice are a way of forging new facts about the world.` In your games you could re-cast a string of bad luck as being the curse of the gods, or give a character a reputation for their misfortune. Success could breed opportunities for advancement, maybe a series of lucky critical hits is an opportunity to establish that the wizard actually is the daughter of a master swordsman.

This can be a fun form of emergent storytelling. It also helps create a more coherent world instead of one ruled largely by chance. However there can also be downsides.

Turning a string of failures into a character flaw can feel like an additional punishment. You didn't sign up to play a character with some crippling weakness, so why should the dice dictate this in a way extraneous to the specifics of the mechanics? Also it re-casts what rolling dice means.

Ask yourself, if your elf with +30 to seeing ambushes fails a perception roll during their watch, how do you frame this story?

- Is it that they happened to be looking the wrong way? That the +30 represents not just their innate capacity, but rather reflects that they are more likely to be in scenes where the premise is that they have found something?
- Did something exceptional have to interene? With a +30 success would be expected, so should we as a group contrive some unique circumstance to explain the unlikely? Retroactively suggest a night of hard partying? Suggest the influence of evil gods distracted them at a critical juncture?

### Dice Represent the Unknown

The two examples above lead to the next point. What do the dice mean?

Consider a rogue in a system where they have to roll to leap across a raging river. Due to chance they roll poorly, and the mechanics of the system indicate some sort of failure. You can portray this a few ways.

- You try to leap across but do not succeed. Despite your skill nothing is certain. You plunge into the waters below.
- Approaching the cliff the rocks tumble from beneath your feet. Your proud leap fails as the ground drops away, casting you and the embankment into the river.
- The distance across was larger that you imagined. What seemed difficult, if possible, for a rogue of your skill turns out to be an impossible feat. Only midair do you realize your hubris, and the rushing rapids your doom.
- Wow, you really sucked this time. You fall.

Each of these sees character skill in a different way. On one hand it can be a literal representation of aptitude, distilled in an objective format. On the other it could be a narritive conceit that this character tends to somewhow pull through in these circumstances. Maybe your bumbling rogue isn't that sneaky, but their +20 stealth is simply an anime-like luckiness that ends them up in the right places at the wrong times through no fault of their own.

And what of the die roll? Does a high roll mean you're having a good day? Or that the situation aligned in your favor? You could even treat skills as fixed and instead roll to determine the degree of challenge an an impromptu way as the conflict rises to a crisis.

There's no real conclusion, up to you how you portray this in games you play. But it does lead to the final way (for today) that you can use the dice.

### Dice Force Creativity

Much like how DCC is gleefully ready for a random goblin to put an end to you, you can also be willing to let the dice fly and treat them as a way to break down preconceptions.

[Mythic Bastionland](https://www.bastionland.com/2022/07/primeval-bastionland-playtest.html) has random events which ask the GM to radically change the map as rivers flood. At any moment you could be moments away from rolling a result which says the entire capital city that your group set out from is now underwater.

But maybe this is a good thing?

If stories which are only reasoable to what the GM has preconceieved happen, then there are barriers on where the shared storyetlling can go. The system can force you to be creative in the face of adversity. Maybe you don't want this, and if not, see section 1: don't play a system where this is possible.

Or you do. 

Let the dice fly. Have a game where an innocuous goblin scores a critical hit on an adventurer and is revealed to be Darkblade, legendary goblin assassin. Or another where a few natural 20s forces your characters family to confront that they live in a fickle world where every battle has the chance of death, and now must contend with the shame of having their greatest scion killed by a stray arrow.
