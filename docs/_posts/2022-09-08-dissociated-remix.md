## The Mercenary NPC Template

Lets look at some different perspectives on the same NPC ability; the Mercenary from [Lancer][lancer]

![Mercenary NPC Template from Lancer](/assets/post-specific/dissociated-remix/lancer-mercenary-npc-template.png)

The two main abilities were going to look at are `Bounty Hunter` and `Favors Owed`, specifically with how they affect the narrative of a game due to being somewhat [dissociated mechanics][dissociated-mechanics]. 

> **Bounty Hunter**
>
> Before combat begins, the GM chooses a PC: they
have a bounty on their head. Any Mercenaries in the
combat gain +1 accuracy on all attacks, checks, and saves
against that character – pilot and mech.


> **Favors Owed** *Limited 1, Quick Action*
>
> The Mercenary calls in a favor: an orbital or artillery
bombardment, targeting a size 2 area within line of
sight and range 30. Characters within the affected area
must succeed on an AGILITY save or take 6/8/12 damage
and be knocked PRONE. On a success, they take half
damage and aren’t knocked PRONE.

Mechanically Favors Owed is a pretty standard ability for an NPC to have. Limited 1 means its only usable once during a mission (which for most NPCs will mean the one battle they are alive and present for), and the rest of it translates to a medium damage AoE which might also disrupt players with a save vs being knocked down. From the perspective of mechanics and combat design, this could add challenge and some unique character to mercenary foes; maybe players have to be cognizant of their positioning to avoid being all caught on the same blast, or in some sense this rewards players who invested into Agility when they are more likely to resist being knocked down.

In terms of the role-playing part of RPG, there is a lot going on. Favors Owed isn't just a grenade, Favors Owed implies that someone just over the ridge-line 
1. Owns an artillery piece
2. Is willing to put it to unsanctioned use as a favor to this mercenary
3. *Tried to kill you*

Naturally many players would ask, "who in the hell is shooting at us and how can we find them next?" But if we just look at the text of the ability and the guidelines Lancer has for inventing NPCs, this isn't addressed at all. Its not part of the "beats" of a mission (how Lancer organizes its published adventures), and there aren't guidelines on what this would imply about the legality or reputation of the PCs or NPCs involved here. What we get is a basic and generic description of what this ability does, which is made even stranger since its damage scales with the level of the mercenary NPC - shouldn't damage scale instead with the size of the ion cannon which their friend controls up in space?

There are a few obvious responses (perhaps of a [gamist and narritivist bent respectively][gns])
- don't worry about it - it's meant to be a fun ability to face off against in combat and add variety to the game
- feel free to add a story in about finding whoever shot at them, to the extent that your group is interested in pursing that story - the book can't cover everything so treat it as inspiration

Lets circle back to this after looking at another ability, Bounty Hunter - re-written 4 different ways to emphasize how the same basic combat mechanic can imply different types of RPG theory.

### Bounty Hunter Served 4 Ways

> Shared Storytelling Bounty Hunter
>
> The first time players see this NPC the GM chooses a player: they have an opportunity to reveal why they have a bounty on their head. Working together, ask the player to reveal or invent part of their backstory to answer, "what have you done to have a bounty put on you?" Additionally, the player should choose one of the following:
> - the callsign of the mercenary sent after them
> - the name of the organization offering the bounty
>
> Any Mercenaries in the
combat gain +1 accuracy on all attacks, checks, and saves
against that character – pilot and mech.


> Backstory Consequence Bounty Hunter
>
> Mercenaries specialize in tracking down targets, getting to know a Lancer better than they know themselves. A Mercenary company which has had time to study an individual gains +1 accuracy on all attacks, checks, and saves
against that character, both pilot and mech, during combat. This bonus applies to all fellow Mercenaries which fight alongside them.
>
> Most Mercenaries only put in this level of work against "targets of interest"; those who have bounties on their heads.


> Technobabble Justification Bounty Hunter
>
> Mercenary mechs come equipped with dedicated targeting and threat-analysis systems, continuously fed with data from the OmniNet. At the start of combat choose a character for which there is an outstanding bounty, any Mercenaries in the
combat gain +1 accuracy on all attacks, checks, and saves
against that character – pilot and mech.

> Rules Don't Control the Story Bounty Hunter
>
> Before combat begins, the GM chooses a PC: any Mercenaries in the
combat gain +1 accuracy on all attacks, checks, and saves
against that character – pilot and mech.

Each of these has the same general mechanical effect, a consistent bonus against one player during combat, but each of these also implies a different story. The two main dimensions to consider are
- does the introduction of this NPC as a mechanical entity into the game manifest the story-based notion of the bounty? the other way around? or are they even meaningful related?
- does the bonus originate as a result of an element in-universe (such as a mech system)? or as a consequence of narrative tension? or perhaps the bonus leads to engagement instead of the other way around?

It is, of course, up to you how much you want to ground the rules of the game in the agreed-upon fiction of the world (perhaps even [you][prismatic-mystery] [don't][anti-canon]). 

From my perspective I think post-facto justifications, such as the original and Shared Storytelling Bounty Hunter, are less interesting than emergent gameplay. If the world does not follow naturally as a consequence of "real within the world" events, then things tend to seem more "random." It also raises lots of loose narrative threads; why did my character end up with a bounty in the first place? why couldn't I have found out about this before? how much is the bounty worth?

These questions could be interesting, and if you really want to maintain a looser game I think the Shared Storytelling option would give you that power in an interesting way. It is more interesting than the blandest of Rules Don't Control the Story Bounty Hunter - which denies even the possibility that the mechanics of the game can be related to the story of the game. This is a fallacy I see quite often when GMs contrast "combat" and "roleplaying", combat is just roleplaying with guns. Although many games have far more structured and gamey systems for tactical battle, what we still have is a dramatic conflict between parties with opposing interests, unique backstories, an uncertain outcome - all the elements of a great scene.

Technobabble Bounty Hunter and Backstory Bounty Hunter both imply that this bonus is the result of some system or talent which these NPCs have, not unlike how player mechs have unique systems and choose talents each level to represent their training and unique skills. We will have to leave aside the question of why PCs can't learn these traits, that is a whole other can of worms.

But accepting the basic premise that Lancer is a world where training, desire, or unique systems improve combat capability, then those two versions naturally fit with this world. They also add *requirements* based on the story, rather than conjuring story out of thin air. Instead of a bonus which manifests the story of a bounty, the bonuses become contingent on a bounty being a pre-existing element of the world. Further, by instantiating the source of the bonuses they become more grounded in the fiction. That the mercenaries had to spend time studying your character might lead to additional stories about how the they found you.

Having the bounty lead to the mercenaries can add a mechanical element of foreshadowing. Players who know the book will realize that they live in a world where having a bounty on their heads can lead to a squad of +1 accuracy guys showing up to collect. So rather than being a one-off moment, where their arrival both raises and resolve the story of a bounty, now we have worldbuilding and an interesting threat.

## Calling in a Favor for the Conclusion

Now that the conclusion is within line of sight we can hit it for 12 damage and force it to make an Agility save or be knocked prone.

I would remove Favors Owed entirely, an interesting but fundamentally flawed idea. If I wanted to incorporate an artillery bombardment into the story, I'd incorporate artillery into the story - placing this idea within the realm of encounter/campaign design and not a particular NPC ability.

Here's the conclusion, some core assumptions behind all this
- the mechanics of the game should reflect and emphasize elements of the game world - this strong connection leads to more detailed stories and breaks down the barrier between 'combat' and 'roleplay' into a single thing, experiencing the world as your character
- events in the game should flow from previous events in the game - this centers the players and their choices, as most of the events of the game will be driven by their agency. Additionally it avoids inconsistencies or times where players wonder why they couldn't have prevented something, because the events which lead to this moment have already been played through its already part of the experience, not an unforeseeable twist
