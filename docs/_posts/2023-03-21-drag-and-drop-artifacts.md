Artifacts and other objects of power and legend are a central feature of fantasy RPGs. For them to have a greater presence in the world here are a few ways to bring them to your table.

- place the artifact in an evocative location
- add 'random encounters' which reflect its nature and draw players in
- suggest 'adventure hooks' for how it might be used in your game
- create connections between the artifacts and other locations, history, and lore

Let's start with an example, then later can boil down the theory.

## The Black Flame
An object of oppressive and creeping evil, the black flame contains a single grain of sand from the infinite cursed desert.
**Description**: jagged grey gem resembling a fire frozen in place, radiates a malignant heat, light passing through is split like a prism - yet in reverse

**Portents**
1. A dry wind blows from the Black Flame's home
2. Blasting heat persists for a week, requiring double normal rations to survive unless measures are taken to survive in arid conditions
3. A single weakened *sands ghoul* roams under the noonday sun
4. A sudden blast of scorching wind turns a random liquid to sand, potentially a potion or even a nearby small body of water
5. Evil dreams arrive on the winds at night. True rest is difficult, plagued by visions of an eternal desert
6. Choose a nearby creature lair or other encounter, these have become afflicted by the gem and have turned into *sands ghouls* 

**Powers**
- Any who die within 300 ft. of the Black Flame return the following noon as *sands ghouls*
- Able to turn lands into desert over time, blocked only by running water
- Placing the gem on sandy ground and promising your life to it allows the creation of a huge earth elemental, with the gem at it's heart. Each round it remains active the invoker looses a point of constitution - until they die. After which the gem drops to the ground.
- If held aloft in bright light the gem casts a *prismatic spray* up to three times per day, refreshed if left out in the noonday sun. 

**Location**: The Black Flame is contained on a tiny island in the center of a river. The continual flow of water keeps it trapped. The island itself is devoid of all life, home only to a series of stone monoliths about the chamber in which it resides. Each monolith is jagged like obsidian, and bears engravings resembling the skulls of every type of creature known to their creators.

Undead cursed by the flame hide beneath the sand, ready to strike. Most times this will take the form of 2d4 *sands ghouls*.

**Connections**
- Records of a forbidden location are kept in the *Book of Doom*, a tome recording tales of existential threats to the lands. Many tales within the book are exaggerated, but the tales of the Black Flame are instead rather terse - the original authors not wanting tales of the flame's power to inspire greedy treasure seekers. Place a volume within a wizard's tower, library, or nearby chapel.
- Evil winds whisper to those already bent on destruction. Choose a nearby NPC who might be susceptible to these dreams, arriving abstractly as visions when the winds align. Visions which speak of building a dam somewhere upriver.

**Adventure Seeds**
- Unleashing the Flame - the river containing the Black Flame ceases to be, allowing its evil to permeate the world. Over the course of a month the surrounding hex will become a cursed desert. Before the next new moon the desert spreads. Although strong woodland or damp bog are resistant to this in time the spreading peril will present a grave danger to the entire region.
- Extinguishing the Flame - knowing of its dire peril a wise man seeks a group of adventurers with both the moral certainty and skill at arms to remove the Black Flame from where it is contained, and take it to the middle of the ocean where it can no longer cause harm. Such a journey would need to be swift however, as its power will only grow once removed from its prison.

### Sands Ghouls
Same stats as ghoul, except unable to cause paralysis. Instead wounds dealt by them leak sand and can only heal when submerged in running water (Knowledge: Religion DC 20 identifies this immediately, otherwise requires investigation). When in a desert they have maximum hit points per hit die and start each day with 10 temporary additional hit points. In fertile lands they have minimum hit points per hit die, and in running water they suffer 2d10 damage per round. 

Other creatures can also become cursed, possibly with unique effects, but most generally gain the undead type, the above ability, and +2 Dexterity.

## Drag and Drop Artifacts

Lets go over quickly what each entry is used for.
- description: physical appearance and flavor
- portents: when generating random encounters, use these if an 'encounter' with a nearby artifact comes up. Run each of them in order. If all six have been run feel free to bring an adventure hook into play, or ignore additional rolls.
- powers: what the artifact can do and general potency
- location: choose a hex on the hexmap, add this location and the artifact there
- connections: when adding the artifact to your game, included these connections at appropriate areas or characters
- adventure seeds: ideas for how to generate stories and plot hooks if you want the artifact to play a larger role in the game, or suggestions for what to do next if it becomes a focus for the player should they encounter it

The idea is that monster manual entries are a way to drag and drop new ideas into your game, and artifacts should have the same support. But more than just being powerful items they should affect the world around them, and allow for ongoing stories. 

This is the motivation behind connections, a more-connected hexcrawl is a more interesting adventure. Although you can always improvise connections you can also take the opportunity to fill out more of the map as you add the artifact in. It isn't just about one location, but about its impact. This is the same motivation behind the portents.

Each portent is an event or an encounter which you can pull from. Treating the artifact in a way similar to a monster lair or a dungeon. Some are designed to draw adventurers in, while others simply reflect the nature of the artifact itself by providing color to surrounding areas.

Lastly the big question is, "well, what if players pick it up?" That's where the adventure seeds come in. Ultimately your game and your group will be a totally unique situation, but by providing a few suggestions this can shape where you go next with the story. Whats most important is providing DMs tools to use, so the descriptions are intended to be added to - rather than create negative space.

In general this is something I'm going to try using for my games to fill out the world. More on this next time.
