The clickbait: Generalist characters are bad

## If All You Have is a Hammer

This issue is perfectly summed up by looking at the one-page RPG [Lasers and Feelings][laser-feelings]. Whats important is you have a mutually exclusive choice to either build your character to be good at either "LASERS" or "FEELINGS" on a scale from 2 to 5.

Because they are opposites there are really only two character builds
- 2 or 5 - you are VERY good when using your favored approach (5/6 to succeed), and moderately bad otherwise (2/6 to succeed)
- 3 or 4 - you are pretty good with your favored approach (4/6), and not that bad otherwise (3/6)

What does this really mean though? Because the game is about choosing your approach to problems having a more balanced build means there is less correlation between being able to use your favored approach and your chances of success. With Lasers and Feelings in particular when you start to roll more dice the difference gets even larger. On a 2 dice pool you have around a 97% chance of success on your favorite ability, while only an 89% chance for the "balanced" build.

Imagine a theoretical character that was exactly as good at both approaches, this would mean that mechanically speaking how they choose to approach a situation will have absolutely no bearing on their chances of success.

On the other hand if all you have is a hammer, and you also get to choose to fight nails, things will work out pretty well.

## The General Issue of Generalists

Lots of RPGs end up encouraging builds to hyper-specialize because you only ever engage in one type of resolution for a given roll/situation. In a game where you have to either talk fast or shoot faster, if you are very good at shooting, then shoot first; if instead you want to talk things out, have a +9000 to talking. 

You could point out that players don't always get to choose the battlefield, which can be true in some games. However, this means that having a specialized character is essentially betting on your ability to be able to make those choices. Be it through system mastery, force of personality, compelling roleplaying, clever planning, or any other skill - having a balanced character is a way to hedge bets without going big. 

And since most games resolve situations with some mechanic, and reward big numbers with either larger chances of success or greater effects of success, then there's an incentive to play to your strengths and not waste points on situations you want to avoid. Think about it, how many games have you played where you level up and can choose for your wizard to gain even greater arcane power, or to be moderately less bad at using a sword, does it actually make sense to go for sword?

## How Some Games Address This

Some games largely separate domains of play into more or less parallel tracks which don't meet. Lancer, Pathfinder, Dungeons and Dragons; every character is basically a combat character. The only 'party role' in DnD is doing damage to win the encounter, certainly there are many paths to being an effective combat character, but levels = greater killing power. Alongside this there are narrative skill systems, or maybe points in Diplomacy, but usually there's little opportunity cost to having a few "FEELINGS" alongside whatever your main build is.

Games in the World of Darkness vein tend to use scaling costs to (potentially) give generalists a bit of an edge by effectively giving them more total points on their sheet. 

## Fin

This isn't to say that people who enjoy playing generalists aren't correct, or that we have to play with *optimal winning* in mind. The point is how a system where there are opportunity costs to advancement, various domains to approach a problem, and mechanics which allow problems to be addressed with some subset of a character's abilities, all lead to a perverse incentive to specialize.
