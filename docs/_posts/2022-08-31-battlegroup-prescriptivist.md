The pitch: what if instead of mandating right and wrong forms of play, Battlegroup explained its design ethos to show you why it is played?

## Battlegroup Tells You How to Play

The designers over at Massif Press just released a new game in the far-future mecha world of Lancer, letting players take command as fleet admirals in [Lancer: Battlegroup][battlegroup]. One thing which I find striking is how specific Lancer can be with its instructions to GameMasters for how the structure and social contract of a game should be. Lets look at what Battlegroup says

> In the briefing, the GM tells the players anything and everything that they need to know going into the fight. The GM’s overall responsibility in the briefing is to provide the players with some information they can use when
planning their fleet construction and strategies. The most important part of this is that you should never lie to the
players. You don’t necessarily have to tell them every single detail of the enemy forces’ composition or
environmental complications – holding some information close to your chest is fine and even expected.

A specific directive mandating that the GM give honest information to players (specifically player as well, not characters, the distinction is important to Battlegroup's ethos). It even emphasizes this moreso by making the act of running a session of Battlegroup a regimented affair with specific steps

> ...briefing, forecast, preparation, engagement, and aftermath. The first three
stages, which happen before the fighting begins, are important for establishing the stakes and grounding the battle in
a broader narrative context, as fleets rarely engage each other without a reason. They are also important
opportunities for the GM to provide players with information and for players to prepare. It is highly recommended
that you do not skip any of these steps without consulting the rest of your group first.
In some special circumstances – say, a surprise attack catches the players’ battlegroup off guard or some esoteric
weapon yanks them from cruising speed – you might skip the first three stages, jumping directly to Stage 4:
Engagement. Even in a case like this, you’ll likely want to do a little out-of-character run through the briefing,
forecast, and preparation. This ensures that everyone is on board with the situation *as players* and can start to figure
out how their characters will respond to such a sudden engagement.

Whats interesting is that this isn't necessarily a portion of the world-building or the aesthetics of the game, it certainly *can be*, but Battlegroup is very specific that this is a meta-level rule. To ignore this means that you are not playing Battlegroup, or at the very least, playing Battlegroup incorrectly in the view of the designers. One of the examples mentions how you could attempt to weave this into the narrative, but you also could "simply tell the players what modifiers and types of enemies you’re going to put in play" in a rules-first approach.

But why?

If I'm to discuss skipping a step with my group, on what basis would this discussion occur? The book says to do it, so we do it.

## Prescriptive Design Implications

Reading some of the developer's comments and looking through the book there seems to be three main reasons Battlegroup is as insistent as it is
- they do not consider GMs which trick players (assumedly out of spite) to be a healthy form of RPG play
- part of the fun of Battlegroup is tailoring your fleet composition to the encounter, which requires good information to make interesting informed choices
- stakes should always be clear, both for individual die rolls and for entire encounters

Towards this Battlegroup has taking a very **prescriptive** approach, detailing exactly what *is* and *is not* appropriate for running this game. To understand this more lets look at a different example of this sort of advice from Ars Magica.

![Ars Magica 5e - Troupe Style Roleplaying](/assets/post-specific/battlegroup-prescriptivist/ars-troupe-style1.png)

Ars Magica has some similar issues as Battlegroup to unpack, the writers assume that the reader won't necessarily be familiar with a core aspect of its design. Either through being very new to RPGs, or being very set in your ways, both of them want to convey some design principles.

![Ars Magica 5e - Alternative Characters](/assets/post-specific/battlegroup-prescriptivist/ars-alternative-characters.png)

Notice though that Ars Magica tends to be more **descriptive**, explaining what the implications are of different options of play (and offering options at all, instead of rules) and how this could impact your group. It note that playing with alternative characters can "make it easy to introduce new characters", which reflects the overall design philosophy of troupe style roleplaying, but that playing with that structure can limit you to having "rather more magi on an adventure than is ideal."

This is because some of the things that Ars Magica is about are

- the game focuses on playing magi (magic-users) in the setting
- characters will often have their own adventures outside of the interests of the group at large
- players should have the opportunity to play multiple characters in a game which is very character-driven

To summarize the main points, I think there are at least two ways in which an RPG can convey its core themes and design principles. A game can be written which very explicitly to require GMs and players behave in certain ways in order to play correctly, or a game can lay out its philosophy and the implications of choosing different interpretations. (There is, of course, the third way, where the game simply assumes everyone is on board and never addresses any of this - quite a favorite of some editions of Dungeons and Dragons)

How would a more prescriptive Ars Magica look? Maybe it would go something like

> Before embarking on a particular story decide who the Storyguide will be, and each player chooses one of their characters to participate in this story. For a story motivated by a magi's story flaw they must choose their magi and other players are recommended to portray companion characters related to the main participant's backstory.
> 
> Sit down with all players and lay out the core themes and challenges of the story, being sure to answer ALL of the following as well as any additional questions players have:
- Is combat a major focus of this story? Will the risk of character death be prevelant?
- How many sessions out-of-game, and how many seasons in-game, will the story be expected to cover?
- What are the stakes for this story? Is this part of an ongoing narrative or the conclusion to an arc?
- Will difficulty interacting with mundanes be a major component? What types of interaction are expected?

Conversely maybe Battlegroup could say that

> When running Battlegroup keep in mind that tailoring fleet composition to the enemy is a key part of how players engage with the game. This requires them to be able to access truthful information to make informed and interesting decisions about what type of fleet to bring, meaning that encounters which obfuscate this information may be less engaging. There are many highly specialized systems which can be very interesting to use, but may make a player who chooses them feel left out if they are not relevant; always being forced to design a fleet to be prepared for any foe will tend to push players towards more generic compositions.
> 
> Remember that being a GM for Battlegroup is not a competitive game, the role of the GM is to portray the world of Lancer and allow players the opportunity to experience being a fleet commander. Although treachery, misdirection, and the vagaries of war are core themes of Battlegroup, your players should always be able to trust you as a GM.

I think in some sense both of these achieve the same overall goal; attempting to convey what a particular RPG is to the reader. But how do these different styles affect the design of their respective games?

## Conclusions?

Reading some of the discussion on the Lancer discord there have always been questions about, "so how much information is good enough?" when giving a briefing. I think this tends to be so difficult to answer because it is framed as a requirement. A descriptive approach would have an answer to this question, "as much information as your group finds useful to make informed choices about fleet composition." 

A potential downside however is this relies on GMs being more experienced and to act in good faith for running the game. In some sense the prescriptive approach is attempting to *gatekeep bad GMs*, bad in both a quasi-moralistic sense of those who are hostile to their players, and in the sense that Battlegroup (like any RPG) is attempting to create a specific experience.

The descriptive approach leaves more room for interpretation, if an Ars Magica storyguide wanted to run a non-troupe-style, high-fantasy, combat-focused game of "Ars Magica except its basically DnD," then there wouldn't really be a specific place in the book you could point at to tell them that they are 'wrong.' Potentially you could argue that it is against the spirit of Ars Magica as laid out in their sections on how a game is run, but without specific rules Ars Magica itself really isn't trying to mandate what you do or don't do in a particular saga.

Lots of groups find this rather self-evident, of course each table will have its own houserules, norms, and social contract. For my part however, I think the benefits of a more descriptive approach outweigh the downsides. Trying to make a codified set of laws to hedge out "incorrect play" will always lead to nitpicky or legalistic arguments, when instead a game can simply put its design ethos up front and leave the rest to players.

## A Few Other Examples

Other games also try to tackle this issue.

Dungeons and Dragons 5th edition has quite a bit of stuff in its Dungeon Master's Guide, although most of it tends to focus on worldbuilding and making maps, with less attention paid to [how DND is run][art-of-rulings]. Theres some focus on particular questions which might come up at your table, but without much resolution on how to run things.

![Dungeons and Dragons 5e - DMG](/assets/post-specific/battlegroup-prescriptivist/dnd-dmg.png)

Dungeon Crawl Classics 8th edition has an elaborate and somewhat obscure oath for would-be GMs. You could argue that being so weighed down with references makes it less approachable to new players, but DCC does consistently convey very much *what it is* through its writing.

![Dungeon Crawl Classics 8th - Admonitions](/assets/post-specific/battlegroup-prescriptivist/dcc-admonitions.png)

Cthulhu Tech has a section on what it means to be a storyguide. Perhaps somewhere between prescriptive and descriptive it seems to lay out a series of goals and responsibilities for what running the game means.
